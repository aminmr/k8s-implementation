# Manual Monitoring

This section is about manual monitoring. In `helm monitoring` section I deployed the monitoring via the prometheus comunity helm repo. In this section all the process has done by manual manifests. 

## Metrics

### Kube-state-metrics

The kube-state-metrics is deployed on `kube-system` namespace and is a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the objects.

For sample and blind deploy you can use the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics//examples/standard
```

### Metric-server

Before starting to deploy the prometheus and other components, you need to install the `metric-server`. 

Metrics Server is a scalable, efficient source of container resource metrics for Kubernetes built-in autoscaling pipelines.

You need to first install it and then follow the steps.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
```

After deploying the metric-server it won't be up and running. The reason is due to the TLS. To disable the tls connection you need to add the ‚Äç`- --kubelet-insecure-tls` to the `args` section in pod yaml file:

```bash
args:
- --cert-dir=/tmp
- --secure-port=4443
- --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname
- --kubelet-use-node-status-port
- --kubelet-insecure-tls
```

### Node-exporter

For node metrics I used `node-exporter`. node-exporter needs to deployed as a `DaemonSet` to expose all nodes metrics. The node-exporter mount `/sys` and `/` for expose metrics.

To deploy the node-exporter follow the commands:

```shell
kubectl apply -f node-exporter/nodeExporterDaemonSet.yaml
kubectl apply -f node-exporter/nodeExportersvc.yaml
```

## Prometheus

### ClusterRole

First of all we are going to implement the prometheus stack. The prometheus needs to fetch the kubernetes metrics. But for security consideration we need to create `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` to only access the `monitoring` namespace to get the metrics.

**Note:** If you want to add more resources of your kubernetes cluster, you need to edit the clusterrole manifests and apply it.

You can apply the `clusterRole.yaml` as following:

```shell
kubectl apply -f prometheus-stack/clusterRole.yaml
```

### ConfigMap

The most important part of prometheus is `prometheus.yaml` for configurations and `prometheus.rules` for prometheus rules. Both these two files are available in one file.

If you want to change any configuration you can apply it through this `ConfigMap`.

You can apply the `configMap.yaml `as following:

```shell
kubectl apply -f prometheus-stack/configMap.yaml
```

`prometheus.rules:`

Prepare in future updates.

`prometheus.yaml:`

- node-exporter
- kubernetes-apiservers
- kubernetes-nodes
- kubernetes-pods
- kube-state-metrics
- kubernetes-cadvisor
- kubernetes-service-endpoints

### Deployment

Now it's time to apply the deployment. These configuration are important in prometheus-deployment:

1. Add prometheus ConfigMap(Prometheus.yaml and prometheus.rules)
2. Prometheus args.
3. Prometheus pvc for data store (This should be add in near future)

### Services

For accessing the prometheus you need to provide a service.

You can deploy this service as a `ClusterIP` via the following yaml file:

```shell
kubectl apply -f prometheus-stack/prometheus-deployment.yaml
```

## AlertManager

### ConfigMap

This ConfigMap contains `config.yaml` for alertManager. You can deploy via the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f alertManager/alertManagerConfigmap.yaml
```

### TemplateConfigMap

This ConfigMap contains `default.tmpl` for alertmanager template. You can deploy via the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f alertManager/alertManagerTemplateConfigmap.yaml
```

### Deployment

And the deployment which use the official image and two previous template to deploy the alertmanager. Try the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f alertManager/alertManagerDeployment.yaml
```

### Service

And the service is to access the alertManager:

```
kubectl apply -f alertManager/alertManagerService.yaml
```

## Grafana

### DataSource

This ConfigMap contains `prometheus.yaml` file which contains the datasource. Our datasource is prometheus. To apply this configmap:

```shell
kubectl apply -f grafana/grafana-datasource-config.yaml
```

### Deployment

```shell
kubectl apply -f grafana/grafana-deployment.yaml
```

### Service

```shell
kubectl apply -f grafana/grafana-deployment.yaml
```
